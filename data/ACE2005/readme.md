Dataset for ACE2005 can be obtained from (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06). Note that the files are not for free!

After obtaining the files, preprocessing can be done by following the instructions from (https://github.com/LorrinWWW/two-are-better-than-one/tree/master/datasets)

Then, you should rename the related files as "train_triples.json", "dev_triples.json" and "test_triples.json".
